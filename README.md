# 🚨Attention🚨
**I am stopping further development of this project as I have decided to upgrade to the new version of Minecraft 1.21.1. Follow the development [here](https://discord.gg/CDRrU3kK7p)**

### This is my first modpack, please do not judge harshly

# 🌋What's the modpack?
**A modpack for playing with friends, combining with mods such as 
[Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create), 
[Mekanism](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism), 
[Computer Craft](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked), 
[Electrodynamics](https://modrinth.com/mod/electrodynamics), 
[Immersive Engineering](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersiveengineering/versions) and 
[Nuclear Science](https://modrinth.com/mod/nuclear-science), 
with more improved vanilla minecraft. The modpack is a Technical**

# ✨Vanilla
**I in the package improved vanilla minecraft adding new chips, it has many, no even very many mods improving vanilla minecraft. I was looking for mods that more or less fit in vanilla and improve it**

# ⚡Performance
**With every modpack update I try to improve performance so that FPS does not drop and it is comfortable to play. Now this is considered a serious problem for me, because I am not good at optimization. In the next update I will try to solve this problem**

# 🏭Industrial
**That's what I created the modpack itself and this section for, namely the industry in terms of Mekanism, Create and others. I created the modpack based on this idea of mine. There are many mods in the modpack adding technology. I mainly based this modpack on the mod Mekanism and Create to play with friends**
